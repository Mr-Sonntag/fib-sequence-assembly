# fib-sequence-assembly
This is my final project in a CIS class for my AS Computer Science degree.

This program is written in assembly and showcases a modified fibonacci sequence that asks the user for three integers as an input. The first two integers will declare the start of the fibonacci sequence.
The third integer will then be asked from the user which will set the number of iterations the fibonacci sequence should iterate, under the constraints of 3 < i < 20.
For example, if the user entered '1', '1', and '4' as the input, the program will return "1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8" as the fibonacci sequence output. 

This program demonstrates a deep understanding of the fibonacci sequence, core programming techniques, data structures, problem-solving, computer hardware & cpu architecture, documentation, convetional programming,
and more. While in other programming languages, this type of program can usually be written with ease. Since this was written in assembly, this proves my capablities of learning complex programming languages 
and implementing high-level thinking for problem-solving.
